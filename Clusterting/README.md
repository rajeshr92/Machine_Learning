# Birch Clustering

Data  visualization  is  a  key  element  in  understanding  data  and  visualization  categorically enhances  better  understanding  and  readability.  A  precursor  to  such  an  attempt  is  classifying datasets, where  the  classifier  is  the  output.  However,  constraints  can  limit  attempts  to  classify data,  which  is  when  clustering  provide  better  visualization.  This  report  outlines  an  attempt  to implement  clustering  algorithm  to  a  given  Birch  Clustering  Dataset. This  dataset  contains  two columns,  which  appear  to  be  random  pointsin  random  locations. Out  of  the  many  clustering algorithms, k-means clustering method was primarily studied. This supervised learning technique partitions  100,000  observations  into  clusters  ranging  from  2  to  30.  The  optimal  number  of clusters was determined by evaluating the mean distance for increments of clusters from 2 to 30 in addition to studying the silhouette value and visual implication post-clustering.The silhouette value ranges from-1 to +1 andobservations within a cluster closer to 1 indicate better clustering distinction.
