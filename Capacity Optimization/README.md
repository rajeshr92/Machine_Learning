# Capacity Optimization - Genetic Algorithm

Typical  perception  of  machine  learning  entails  predicting  the  outcome  from  past  data  and outcomes. However, Genetic Algorithm is a machine learning concept that caters to optimizing operations  to  meet  a  set  of  desired  conditions.  This  assignment  has  two  parts;  1:  Optimize delivery  from  point  A  to  point  B  when  capacity  is  constrained  and  2:  Determining  the  global minima  for  a  given  function  dependent  on  two  unbounded  variables,  ‘x’  and  ‘y’.  To  give  a deeper perspective of the first part, ‘a large truck must be  loaded  with  supplies  to  a  support research  team  operating  in  Artic  and can  travel  just  once  to  the  site.  The  maximum capacity  of this  truck  is  113  Mg’ [1].    The  item  list  along  with  its  respective  importance  and  mass  are provided to perform the analysis.
