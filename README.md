# Data Structures and Algorithms using Python

Algorithmic and Computational thinking are the backbone of tech. This repo is specifically for showcasing the implementation of different algorithms and data structures problems using python. 

Python is an getting increasingly popular in the industry. It is predominantly popular for its AI/ML framework, but is gaining popularity in app development frameworks. It is equally capable to be a scripting language and used for OOP.

## Environment Used

Python is an open source language, which gives a lot of freedom. This implementation was done using IDLE 3.6 64-bit.

## Projects 

Popular data strcutures and algorithms are implemented using OOP methods in python. The repo contains problems and implementations around the following: 

* list
* dictionary
* graph
* linked list
* stacks
* queues 

## Reference

Educative.io is an excellent online education platform that has methodical courses to learn data structures using Python
