# Machine Learning 

This repo has .m code for machine learning projects using popular ML methods; Artificial Neural Networks, Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, and Decision Trees to name a few. 

The main project that encompassed many models was on Diabetic Retinopathy, a severe eye condition stemming from diabetes.

## Environment Used

Among the several tools available for AI/ML, these projects used Matlab by Mathworks. 

## Projects 

Following are the projects in this repo: 

* Diabetic Retinopathy - Used decision trees and ANN to classify pre-processed retinal images either as susceptible to diabetic retinopathy or not
* Birch Clustering - Introductory project to supervised learning and determinig optimal number of clusters
* Building Occupancy - Decision tree used to classify whether a space is occupied or not given a set of observations of the space
* Kidney Disease - Given patient health and personal information, classifying the patient with/without Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
* Benzene Concentration - Using ANN to determine the benzene concentration in the air, given a set of attributes on air quality
* Capacity Optimization - a genetic algorithm used to take initial and boundary conditions and maximize cargo in a given limited space
