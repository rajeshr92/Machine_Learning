# Chronic Kidney Disease - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

In  the  quest  to  classify  new  observations  into  one  or  more  categories  based  on  previous  data,  culminated  the  development  of  classification  algorithms  such  as  CART,  Random  Forest,  and  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM).  The  analysis  done  in  this  project primarily  focusses  on  applying SVM to dataset that predicts the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The  prediction  is  influenced  by  24  other  predictors,  using  which  a  5-fold  cross-validation  was  performed and for each fold, a SVM model was built using Matlab inbuilt functions. The model was studied and developed by iterating different kernel functions and box constraint values. The outcome  of  the  model  was  evaluated  based  on  the  accuracy  determined  from  sensitivity  and  specificity analysis.
